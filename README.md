Edu Burg ERP is a student management system including social media. In this application any academic institute can manage their students and teachers (ex-course offer, result, payment system, payment history and any kind of academic curriculum). But Edu Burg ERP can be used as a social media platform as well. Teachers and Students can post anything, react on a post and comment on a post. Also students can communicate with their teachers directly. There is no need to use 3rd party social media sites, like facebook, twitter etc.
